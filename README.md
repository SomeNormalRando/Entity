# Entity
This is the repository for my Discord bot, Entity, made in JavaScript with Discord.js as a library.

I learnt programming (more specifically the JS language) by making this bot, and still am.

It's pretty useless at the moment, but I plan to add more commands as I learn more.

Everything that makes the bot work is in the `src` directory.
